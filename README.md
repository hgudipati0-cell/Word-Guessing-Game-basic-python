# Word-Guessing-Game-basic-python
A guided project for beginner level python by creating a word guessing game using basic Python

Although guided, the guidance was straightforward but hardly specific enough for me to "copy and paste" the directions directly.
The project allowed me critically think about what kind of conditions to use and what loops to initialize.
The game is low quality, but this was one of my first projects, so I hope you guys like it!
